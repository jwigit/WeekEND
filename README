Introduction
============
WeekEND v 0.01 was released in November 1996 to solve a practical problem
I encountered in batch programming: telling the weekday (as an exit code).

Now 15 years later, apparently there are still a few users of WeekEND.
Unfortunately they have encountered a problem in the original version. Sundays
are misrepresented as the 25th week day :-)

I do not think that there is anything wrong in the original version and that
it will still run fine under the operative systems of the day. However I do
suspect that newer versions of Windows does not honour or emulate the MS-DOS
6.0 API (application programming interface) perfectly.

Rewrite
=======
The old WeekEND was written for DOS, in assembly language, accessing the API
through interrupts.

Today I do not have access to a DOS computer, the source code is 1407kms
away, and I only use assembly language to optimise numerical code.

- This necessitates a rewrite.

For UNIX, POSIX.2-1992 specifies necessary functions to retrieve the weekday.
The C99 standardised version of the C programming language incorporates
POSIX.2-1992 and should be ideal for implementing a stable version of WeekEND
on all platforms.

Usage
=====
weekend cmd

Where cmd:
	-h gives help
	-l shows the license
	-d return (as exit code) the week day as 1=Monday, ..., 7=Sunday
	-p return POSIX week day (as exit code), i.e. 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ...

For silent operation use -sd or -sp

The - prefix can be replaced by /

Time in the current locale is used
